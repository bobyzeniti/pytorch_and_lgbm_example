# Machine Learning example using Pytorch + LGBM:
General machine learning regression using Pytorch and LGBM ensemble. <br>
This ML model applies deep learning (PyTorch) and Gradient Boosted Trees (LGBM) to predict closing stock price movements based on order book information. <br>
<br>
It implements some interesting codes such as reduced memory usage. <br><br>
It can be used to solve any problems where Deep learning and/or LGBM might be useful.
